Lightning stages this perfect\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0vacancy like so many camera flashes.\n\n For a moment, you are famous. Even god\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0is looking for you.\nii\n\n The sugarcanes we chewed grew\n\n in runoff \u200awater from the Tylenol factory.\n\n Our daily hunt and gather, first stash\n\n behind mom\u2019s back. We jammed those\n\n fibers between our cheeks and molars\n\n like tobacco, found wild strawberries\n\n big as a pugilist\u2019s fist. You taught me how\n\n to pitch rocks at the rainwater pond.\n\n The slickest stones went farthest.\n\n That was always the goal, right? To watch\n\n their bodies revolve away from our own.\niii\n\n To wake me up, you\u2019d press\n\n my tongue to the nipple\n\n of \u200aa AA battery. I press\n\n my ear to the door\n\n of\u200a AA meetings. Was that\n\n your voice I heard\n\n rejoicing? I\u2019d try anything\n\n to be better than you.\n\n Brother, give me your turmeric\n\n chews, your sexual awakenings,\n\n your coupons for muscle\n\n -building milkshakes, your first\n\n kiss. Give me your vouchers\n\n for one free therapy session.\n\n Shake out your boombox, please.\n\n Press those D cells to my lips.\niv\n\n You\u2019re in a small room cutting\n\n rugs. There\u2019s no music playing, no ballad\n\n troubling your movement. Your bony legs\n\n cross each other like witching rods.\n\n When you shimmy the mirrors blush.\n\n You\u2019ve never looked so alive, down\n\n lit through the skylight. The stars\n\n are pinholes hemorrhaging moonlight\n\n through a bedsheet. In the dream,\n\n you sashay to the wall of my mind,\n\n waltz through so many handfuls\n\n of \u200asilence. You look gorgeous, spinning\n\n the minute hand of a clock\u2014forwards\n\n or backwards, I can\u2019t tell."

titles or land not on the property register.\n\nThis was land not documented as belonging to anybody but the companies had appropriated it as though they were the owners.\nMy actions of course resulted in me being persecuted and going to prison 22 times.\nI was also submitted to torture at the hands of the authorities.\nYou have to remember that the government of this country at that time boasted about defending private property, but in justifying this, the government defended property which wasn\u2019t private.\nAll a company had to do was put up a sign up on a thousand-hectare area of land, for example, saying Del Monte, even though it wasn\u2019t their property.\nAll they had to do was put a fence around it and bring in a guard or two, or in some cases a lot of guards to protect it, as though it belonged to them.\nFor us this was both illogical and unjust as there were so many homeless workers, so many unemployed banana workers who were suffering.\nFor us the most sensible thing was to make use of this land by planting what we eat.\nFor instance we grow: cassava, rice, beans, maize, tequisque, yamp\u00ed ... 257\n\nWe had to organise the campesinos and the banana workers who didn\u2019t have homes, in order to occupy land where there were no titles or land not on the property register."

Sudden, O\nSong, fallen on me as a passing wind,\nnaming as the wind names\u2014absence, farewell.\nO Shadow Song, whose hill is green and leaving,\nright my walk in glory, begin.\nWhen the trees were leafless, I put my voice,\nO Tenuous Air, among the barren places, among even the\nnothingness of frost. Thinking I knew myself. O Fortifier,\nO Hidden-in-the-weeds, going green. A green concert, hollow green.\nO Ship, your going on without me is my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 entire.\nThy keel floats on, O Possibility. If \u200aI anchor as you.\nIf I set my anchor here. If I can hum through.\nThe necessary masterpiece. If I can respond in kind\nto the loneliness of Wyeth\u2019s Grape Wine, recognizing, turning the corner\nin the great museum, that I am the drifter, O River,\nwith his back turned to his fashioner.\n\u00a0\nHow long had I suffered, white-knuckled, anchored to my name, wanting clearly to walk to wide avenues wearing ornate buttons, wishing to be loved by the god of syntax. Had gone mad and gone, tonguing out my name. This nothingness, I\u2019d proved it upon my pulse. Realized the self was daily. One moment into the next, as turning the corner I expect everyone I\u2019ve known to appear with my other name, a coin in the mouth, a rotten tooth. As if I\u2019m nothing when not regarded, as light is, as is the ancient tongue buried below perceivable language, its many tessellations into sound. I want to be called as you call yourself, I say to the unfolding blooms. How they hold perfection and not announce. Do not announce on the wide avenues, the mountain\u2019s grandeur. The bloom takes part in the mountain. The mountain is my true lover who, before the road, humbles me when I set out trying to know. To understand what is below knowing. Love the mountain. Whose blue face I rise toward, who does not betray, who is mist-clothed, whose water I gather as breathing. Who has been one tree. Who has been a seed. Who stills itself in battle. Who cannot ask, \u201cif then thou gavest.\u201d Whose oath to the bloom is unreachable. O Joiner, let me among that private communion. Let me be all as if I had all.\n\nRelease me, O Redeemer, from the tyranny of my desire\nfor that which has been weighed against, has killed my people.\nPlace in my path, O Architect,\nthe bitter green medicine that reaches for me,\nthat leans as I do towards the sun,\nthat huddles together as my people in praise of you,\nyour name\u2014a sharp taste in my mouth, a righteous sound\nI can lean against. O Transformer, whose blessings multiply\nbefore me as yarrow by the train tracks. I trust in\nthe givenness of things. I trust in the wind and the ache in my knee.\nFor it is thy hum at my center, O Witness, that breathes me.\n                \nHow long had I suffered, white-knuckled, anchored to my name, wanting clearly to walk to wide avenues wearing ornate buttons, wishing to be loved by the god of syntax.

The man\n\n with black hair unruly as crabgrass\n\n will not drop the urn. But how can we\n\n know? What are rules tomorrow\n\n can\u2019t breach? He has forgiven\n\n the urn. They have forgiven each\n\n other. Everything can now go unsaid.\n\n Still: the man holds the urn in the air.\n\n That\u2019s hard to forget. Nobody does."

And later, after it\u2019s dried in the sun, after the flies\n\n have had their fill, we scoop it up and throw it in the woods.\n\n Here, the world is perpetual March,\n\n and we love a dog as if that\u2019s the only thing we can do, as if\n\n death cannot touch this slice of New England, the trees\n\n growing a canopy of shade just for us.\n\n Yesterday, we strapped the smallest life jacket\n\n to her furry body, took her swimming for the first time.\n\n We watched her paddle from the shore to the center of the lake,\n\n then back again until she grew tired. And last night\n\n while we argued about things that won\u2019t\n\n matter in a month, he was still petting the puppy\u2019s wet head,\n\n and I cried like I\u2019d never known a kindness\n\n so pure and gentle as that, as a pat on the head\n\n for doing nothing but existing. I wouldn\u2019t\n\n call this jealousy, but there is no word\n\n in my human tongue that seems appropriate.\n\n It\u2019s the feeling of all the stones I swallowed in my youth\n\n growing \u200ajagged in my belly. And I scratch\n\n the surface of my skin with any sharp thing\n\n I can find to cut them out."

William Noyes\n\n hired a lawyer, who sent the brute to jail.\n\n Because our families\u2019 Fates are intertwined.\n\n I\u2019m sixty-five now. Who could have foreseen\n\n that I\u2019d be sitting out here on my porch\n\n while red-throat whistlers and black-capped dicky-dees\n\n celebrate, and the cherry petals snow.\n\n No more than thirty years ago, who could\n\n have foreseen this as my possible Fate:\n\n a free, white-bearded black man with his wife\n\n sunning together beside their front door,\n\n looking down their forsythia-lined path;\n\n their son out back hammering a horseshoe\n\n in the blacksmith shop; their daughter humming\n\n tunelessly in the kitchen; their grandsons\n\n swearing they\u2019ll finish chores before dinner;\n\n their quiet granddaughter dreaming futures."

Let another\u2019s voice stand in. What distance, far, always the night stretched too long. Standing under orange lights by the rolled-down window of your car, that in-between space. That touch, how seldomly. We cannot resist! So rend me to keep from holding back again and again.\nStaring at the ground during the eclipse the outlines of our bodies bending into unfamiliar shapes.

The book also features a crown of sonnets by Patricia Smith, who is the winner of the 2021 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.\n\n\nIn its beginning, earth was fractured, frail\n with coveting, and could not wait for us\u2014\n so, flailing in the muscled clutch of grace,\n we blessed this sullen place. As we were born\n and born again, in tenements and lush,\n exuberant savannas, flung from hips\n of southern silver, lifted into life\n while mamas shrieked and swore, as we were born\n and born again, emphatic, snared within\n our thrash and wail, our breath already slowed\n by blood\u2019s incessant question in our chests,\n every dazzled witness rose to name\n us yet again. The world was not prepared.\n Inside its realm, no one could fathom us.\n \u00a0\n \nFanta.\u00a0All photographs by Sandro Miller.\n Inside its realm, no one could fathom us\u2014\n we brazen through their shuttered doors, we huge\n inside their throats, we necessary storm,\n our newborn crowns smeared flat with blood, so hot\n against our little heads. The white mistake\n was thinking that, once rinsed and blotted dry,\n the clenched, rebellious snarl was simply hair\n with nothing more to say. They saw instead\n the way our skin corrals and guzzles sun,\n our breathlessness, our legendary hips,\n they saw what commerce needed them to see\u2014\n our backs grown wide and measured for the want\n of work. They missed the hurricane of hair,\n the springing from a thousand wicked roots.\n \u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\nJewell\n That springing from a thousand wicked roots\n was just the brash beginning, just the bray\n of light that hisses warning\u2014Do not touchthis hair. This vibing wire, these bellowed threads\n of thundering, no, do not dare to poke\n a prying finger into dark you do\n not understand. Our hair is blade when we\n decide that it should be\u2014the fools who died\n within its kink would speak of smother if\n they could. Our hair is not your savior. Not\n your kumbaya, your ticket in. When it\n began, so smashed and sleek with blood, we knew\n that it had fist. Our hair can\u2019t be polite.\n Once we were slaves. Our hair was furious.\n \u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\nAwa\n Once we were slaves. Our hair was furious,\n forever springing loose from plaits and bows,\n rejecting homemade greases meant to tame\n the wild and wiry bloom that snapped its bands\n and leapt alive at every chance. At least\n some part of us was running free, like flame\n that hungers for a sky, like praying fixed\n on someplace we knew heaven was. We sang\n our songs but didn\u2019t move our mouths, we burned\n to black inside ourselves. With rivers as\n our mirrors, we began to build a wall\n between our stolen air and us. We snapped\n our dresses to our throats, made sure our hair\n was braided thick against the spit of men.\n \u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bMelody\n Hair braided thick against the spit of men,\n we hurtled forth\u2014for years, we mystified\n the whisper-tressed, but listened when they said\n that we were wrong, not white or silk enough,\n and that we\u2019d never be unless we walked\n into the fire, succumbing to a hate\n we\u2019d hoarded for ourselves. Because they loved\n their blemished daughters, mamas twisted knobs\n on cranky ovens, conjured flame, and made\n us sit on rusted, wobbling kitchen chairs\n beneath the ironing comb that charred our necks,\n beneath the lye that chewed at scalp and root,\n and we endured that hurt, forgot the days\n our chaos crown had bellowed, nap unleashed.\n \u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\nStephanie\n Our crown still fought to bellow, nap unleashed,\n though it was wounded, hammered down with heat\n and oil that stank of animals and flowers,\n although we wept while memorizing pale\n and wispy heads in magazines. We gazed\n and learned to suffer poisons to correct\n our ugly, free us from the blunder of\n ourselves. And as we listened, reaching up\n to touch a stranger\u2019s head\u2014a stranger head\u2014\n with strands that disappeared us, trapped us in\n their strangling glamor, we remembered this\u2014\n that we are people destined to explode.\n So we exploded toward ourselves again.\n \u00a0\n \nStacey\n When we explode, we know ourselves again,\n we shake our funky, liberated heads,\n and raise our voices to the rafters\u2014Do\n not dare touch these crowns. And we are Accra,\n and we are Alabama, Brooklyn, Watts,\n and we are middle finger lifted toward\n the seething witnesses to all this joy,\n and we are Trinidad and Harlem, we\n are bopping straight into the yesterday\n we were, and straight into the history\n we\u2019ve made and straight into tomorrow with\n our rampant naps so gleefully unchecked,\n so unrestrained, entwined \u2019til we become\n a single soul, yet none of us the same.\n \u00a0\n \nAmontance\n A single soul, yet none of us the same,\n we are the only government we need\u2014\n our vivid, cocky crowns stunned in their tilt\n and swirl, they devastate and irritate,\n they be our gospel, be our calling card,\n they be our halo, be the way we reach\n for sky. The crown is ours to snip or dye\n a hundred awkward hues, it\u2019s ours to tuck\n beneath a Sunday hat, to crimp and twist,\n to scissor down to air, much like a man\u2019s.\n This hair is all our other breath. It\u2019s art\n upon our heads, a glory spill. It\u2019s wild,\n bewildering and sexy in its snarl,\n it\u2019s neon, razored, locked and knotted, looped\n \u00a0\n \nMampe\n and neon, razored, locked and knotted, looped\n and razored, locked and neon, looped and not\n the business of just anyone, our hair\n is blatantly political, a staunch\n and blaring tangle, glory in our names,\n the gospel on our bobbing heads, it\u2019s fierce\u2014\n and yes, still furious, still springing loose\n from any peril set on silencing\n its roar. You\u2019ve underestimated us,\n you didn\u2019t know the muscularity of kink\n was busily rebirthing us\u2014it taught\n us all the ways to mouth our names\n with Serengeti tongues, it\u2019s quarrelsome\n and coiled, it\u2019s all the things but always black\n \u00a0\n \nKoketso\n and coiled. This hair is all the things. But, black\n and wily goddesses, we\u2019ve always known\n the powerfulness of wearing our own sky,\n the lyric of the scar, we\u2019ve always known\n that even though they dared to call us slaves,\n we never were. If only they had heard\n the freedom on our heads, the jubilant\n triumphant wail of all that hair, its rude\n unbridled verb, they would have left us free\n to rule our own damned selves, to live our sweet\n and colored lives. Our hair is throat, is knife\n against the throat, is song within the throat,\n it\u2019s how we rock and conquer every room,\n our hair\u2019s the funk, the scorch, Aretha\u2019s growl\n \u00a0\n \nZoya\n is hair, is funk, is scorch, Aretha\u2019s growl\n is one of just a million ways the tale\n is told. It\u2019s told in gospel hurtling toward\n the rafters, told in warnings grunted blue\n and deeper blue by Delta gals, it\u2019s told\n in songs our mamas sang before they threw\n those pressing combs into the fire. Go on\n and raise your eyes to where we rise, go on\n and hail the royalty we be, go on,\n resent the ways we\u2019ve vowed to live our souls\n out loud. But do not touch this hair, the black\n explode, the crowning of it all. Your hands\n will never know a shelter in this heat,\n so sweetly hellish on our perfect heads.\n \u00a0\n \nNina\n So sweetly hellish on our perfect heads,\n this hair has known the yesterdays we know,\n has lived the history we\u2019ve lived. Once we\n were slaves. And then there were the days we sat\n on plastic kitchen chairs while trying not\n to hear the sizzling iron comb, its teeth\n intent on disappearing us. When they\n were freed, embracing wild\u2014each strand became\n a fist that pierced the air, a strident voice\n that sanctified and irritated, each\n and every one its tiny god. You say,It\u2019s only hair, a consequence of blood,\n a quirk of body. What it is is life.\n And even history can\u2019t twist that truth.\n \u00a0\n \nMbali\n Yes. Even history can\u2019t twist the truth,\n can\u2019t warp the telling\u2014see, our hair\u2019s the thing\n that no one else will claim. It makes us like\n nobody else. It seems there is a world\n of silk, of blonde and auburn, pinkish skin\n that coppers under sun, but then\n there\u2019s powerful nappy, there\u2019s the feral curl,\n the everything there is, what Black girls have\n that no one else imagines. Mystery\n prevails\u2014it just may be the kiss of sun\n that\u2019s braided in the braids, the moon that spits\n its liquid light in dreaded ropes. The earth\n was not prepared for what our locks would scream.\n In its beginning, earth was fractured, frail.\n \u00a0\n \nStacey\n In its beginning, earth was fractured, frail\u2014\n outside its realm, no one could fathom us,\n our springing from a single wicked root.\n When we began, our hair was furious\n and braided thick against the spit of men.\n Our chaos crown still razzles, nap unleashed,\n and we explode, always ourselves again,\n a single soul, yet none of us the same.\n It\u2019s neon, razored, crimped and knotted, looped\n and coiled, it\u2019s all the things but always black,\n our hair\u2019s the funk, the scorch, Aretha\u2019s growl,\n it\u2019s sweetly hellish on our perfect heads.\n And even history can\u2019t twist this truth:\n no woman wears the crown except the queen.\n \u00a0\n \n\n\nNzinga\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThis portfolio comes from a book of photographs by Sandro Miller titled Crowns: My Hair, My Soul, My Freedom, which will be published in December 2021 by Skira.

Once we\n\n were slaves. And then there were the days we sat\n\n on plastic kitchen chairs while trying not\n\n to hear the sizzling iron comb, its teeth\n\n intent on disappearing us. When they\n\n were freed, embracing wild\u2014each strand became\n\n a fist that pierced the air, a strident voice\n\n that sanctified and irritated, each\n\n and every one its tiny god. You say,\nIt\u2019s only hair, a consequence of blood,\n\n a quirk of body. What it is is life.\n\n And even history can\u2019t twist that truth.\n\n \u00a0\n \nMbali\n\n Yes. Even history can\u2019t twist the truth,\n\n can\u2019t warp the telling\u2014see, our hair\u2019s the thing\n\n that no one else will claim. It makes us like\n\n nobody else. It seems there is a world\n\n of silk, of blonde and auburn, pinkish skin\n\n that coppers under sun, but then\n\n there\u2019s powerful nappy, there\u2019s the feral curl,\n\n the everything there is, what Black girls have\n\n that no one else imagines. Mystery\n\n prevails\u2014it just may be the kiss of sun\n\n that\u2019s braided in the braids, the moon that spits\n\n its liquid light in dreaded ropes. The earth\n\n was not prepared for what our locks would scream.\n\n In its beginning, earth was fractured, frail.\n\n \u00a0\n \nStacey\n\n In its beginning, earth was fractured, frail\u2014\n\n outside its realm, no one could fathom us,\n\n our springing from a single wicked root.\n\n When we began, our hair was furious\n\n and braided thick against the spit of men.\n\n Our chaos crown still razzles, nap unleashed,\n\n and we explode, always ourselves again,\n\n a single soul, yet none of us the same.\n\n It\u2019s neon, razored, crimped and knotted, looped\n\n and coiled, it\u2019s all the things but always black,\n\n our hair\u2019s the funk, the scorch, Aretha\u2019s growl,\n\n it\u2019s sweetly hellish on our perfect heads.\n\n And even history can\u2019t twist this truth:\n\n no woman wears the crown except the queen.\n\n \u00a0\n \n\n\nNzinga"

It isn\u2019t as easy as saying that I hold people at a distance, but more so that I am always sensing the insurmountable swimming between us, and sometimes this feels like an overwhelming failure.

In this light, two violinists faced each other\u2014a man and a woman. The woman had her back to me.\n\u00a0\n\nTheir bows were like warped mirror images, one stretching out and up as the other pushed down and in, the two lines moving in relation. And in this manner, they made not the same music but an overlapping.\n\u00a0\n\nI began to wonder in that moment (and I still wonder now) why my lips twitch at each discordant twoness.\n\u00a0\n\nIs it joy?

I didn\u2019t follow the men up to where I could have let the tumbling water crash on my shoulders. I stopped at the base of all that, where the sun hit a few dry rocks smooth enough to sit and recline on.\n\u00a0\n\nWhy do I always feel my role, the only thing I have to offer a moment, is the look of me: arranged over a rock in a splash of sun; leaning into a house while violinists play; drawing in a book in the corner of a room?\n\u00a0\n\nLast night my eyes felt embarrassed to land on any human form; they hopped like flies from object to object. I wanted to see, but where to linger, where to stay? There was no purchase. No welcoming ledge. And yet I was not sad, not really. Curious, yes, but not quite sad.\n\n\u00a0\nAugust 23, 2018\nDear G,\n(\n\u00a0\nYesterday I found out by way of a blood test that the embryo inside me no longer exists. I looked at a screen, and there was a number, and the number did not fall in a specified range.\n\u00a0\n\nWhen they executed the procedure where they scoop up the cells with a long eye dropper and inject them into a corner of my uterus, the doctor handed me a photograph of the embryo and said beautiful. What he meant was that it was the picture-perfect image of an embryo at this stage. Did I already feel discomfort then? For a year I have been trying to perfect this process, to pin all the moths in place, even the ones as thin as ghosts.\n\u00a0\n\nIn the doctor\u2019s office today, I kept trying to discern where in my body I was feeling the loss, and the doctor kept pointing to the photograph, calling this part baby and that part placenta, over and over\u2014\n\n)\n\u00a0\nAugust 23, 2018\nDear J,\n\u00a0\nI do not find my birthstone particularly beautiful. Today I told a man this, and he claimed it interesting. It\u2019s just like with your posture, he said. You misname it \u201cbad\u201d because it is yours.\n\u00a0\n\nBack straight as a stack of coins, I nodded my head, but it did not make sense.\n\u00a0\n\nHe thought he had unlocked something about me.\n\u00a0\n\nYou are throwing plastic over it, he said. An ugly plastic.\n\u00a0\n\nYes, I said, not because I agreed, but because I could visualize the act. Me, throwing a dirty milky tarp over something invisible, to see the form. How else but to ugly it?\n\u00a0\n\nBut I did not say this.\n\u00a0\n\nWe have been told certain colors are colors, he said, beautiful colors. You are uncomfortable with adornment.\n\u00a0\n\nYes, I said, uncomfortable.\n\u00a0\n\nHow so are you stone? I asked my forearm silently.\n\u00a0\n\nWe just are, it said.\n\u00a0\n\nWhat should I adorn you with, if not yourself? I asked.\n\n\u00a0\nAugust 24, 2018\nDear G,\n(\n\u00a0\nWhen I was a child, a playmate once showed me how to put socks inside my undershirt to emulate my mother\u2019s body. I was shocked because I had grown up believing we ought to bury our softest parts.\n\u00a0\n\nOnce I took a shower with my mother after swimming in the public pool, and I couldn\u2019t stop staring, couldn\u2019t stop looking away.\n\u00a0\n\nMy mother had warned me: the body does not always give you what you ask of it. When I married my husband, she told me over the phone that never mind what I feel, sometimes my body must lie there to serve another\u2019s needs.\n\u00a0\n\nIn the corner of my childhood bedroom, by the window light, my mother told me, if anyone ever touches me here or here.\n\u00a0\n\nSo later I was confused, when, in the doctor\u2019s office, she simply stood by as he touched me here, and here.\n\n(\n\u00a0\nThroughout this whole year, I have been asking my doctor, a man who touches my innermost parts and never looks me in the eyes, Is this normal?\u00a0Is this normal? Like so many things, it feels like a question I ought to be able to answer by myself, for myself.\n\n(\n\u00a0\nI have womanhood on the mind, that is, I have tenderness, though by that I think I mean something else.\n\u00a0\n\nI am learning new ways to be empty.\n\n(\n\u00a0\nTo have spent my life holding my hands in tightly hidden fists.

Three lanes, a brick building, concertina wire. Someone took my passport through the window and asked what I do for a living.

Every day, details accumulate and remain empty at the same time, and that is the hardest thing about all of this\u2014the way nothingness takes over as one sits waiting for the unknown.

I didn\u2019t follow the men up to where I could have let the tumbling water crash on my shoulders. I stopped at the base of all that, where the sun hit a few dry rocks smooth enough to sit and recline on.\n\u00a0\n\nWhy do I always feel my role, the only thing I have to offer a moment, is the look of me: arranged over a rock in a splash of sun; leaning into a house while violinists play; drawing in a book in the corner of a room?\n\u00a0\n\nLast night my eyes felt embarrassed to land on any human form; they hopped like flies from object to object. I wanted to see, but where to linger, where to stay? There was no purchase. No welcoming ledge. And yet I was not sad, not really. Curious, yes, but not quite sad.\n\n\u00a0\nAugust 23, 2018\nDear G,\n(\n\u00a0\nYesterday I found out by way of a blood test that the embryo inside me no longer exists.

What he meant was that it was the picture-perfect image of an embryo at this stage. Did I already feel discomfort then? For a year I have been trying to perfect this process, to pin all the moths in place, even the ones as thin as ghosts.\n\u00a0\n\nIn the doctor\u2019s office today, I kept trying to discern where in my body I was feeling the loss, and the doctor kept pointing to the photograph, calling this part baby and that part placenta, over and over\u2014\n\n)\n\u00a0\nAugust 23, 2018\nDear J,\n\u00a0\nI do not find my birthstone particularly beautiful.

An ugly plastic.\n\u00a0\n\nYes, I said, not because I agreed, but because I could visualize the act. Me, throwing a dirty milky tarp over something invisible, to see the form. How else but to ugly it?\n\u00a0\n\nBut I did not say this.\n\u00a0\n\nWe have been told certain colors are colors, he said, beautiful colors.

I asked my forearm silently.\n\u00a0\n\nWe just are, it said.\n\u00a0\n\nWhat should I adorn you with, if not yourself?

When I married my husband, she told me over the phone that never mind what I feel, sometimes my body must lie there to serve another\u2019s needs.\n\u00a0\n\nIn the corner of my childhood bedroom, by the window light, my mother told me, if anyone ever touches me here or here.\n\u00a0\n\nSo later I was confused, when, in the doctor\u2019s office, she simply stood by as he touched me here, and here.\n\n(\n\u00a0\nThroughout this whole year, I have been asking my doctor, a man who touches my innermost parts and never looks me in the eyes, Is this normal?\u00a0Is this normal?

Do you remember? I was trying to listen closely. I have been thinking about how I relate to people. It isn\u2019t as easy as saying that I hold people at a distance, but more so that I am always sensing the insurmountable swimming between us, and sometimes this feels like an overwhelming failure. Rilke says love between two people is loving that very expanse, even considering it sacred, and I wonder if there is something transcendent here\u2014a definition for community. Across the distance we hear the air shifting between us, and recognize it for what it is\u2014miracles of texture and movement, tiny collaborations of our bodies navigating an unwieldy space. )\n\n\u00a0\nAugust 21, 2018\nDear J,\n\u00a0\nI am glad you brought up the topic of marriage.\n\u00a0\n\nTonight, at the house where everyone eventually gathers, the only light was made by battery-powered pucks with pointy-tipped orange bulbs programmed to flicker along the porch railing. In this light, two violinists faced each other\u2014a man and a woman. The woman had her back to me.\n\u00a0\n\nTheir bows were like warped mirror images, one stretching out and up as the other pushed down and in, the two lines moving in relation. And in this manner, they made not the same music but an overlapping.\n\u00a0\n\nI began to wonder in that moment (and I still wonder now) why my lips twitch at each discordant twoness.\n\u00a0\n\nIs it joy? A grimace? Recognition?\n\n\u00a0\nAugust 22, 2018\nDear G,\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAugust 22, 2018\nDear J,\n\u00a0\nLast year, I didn\u2019t get in the water here\u2014this year I did.\n\u00a0\n\nI swam to where there were some waterfalls, but the boulders were too slimy and slick for me to trust them. I didn\u2019t follow the men up to where I could have let the tumbling water crash on my shoulders. I stopped at the base of all that, where the sun hit a few dry rocks smooth enough to sit and recline on.\n\u00a0\n\nWhy do I always feel my role, the only thing I have to offer a moment, is the look of me: arranged over a rock in a splash of sun; leaning into a house while violinists play; drawing in a book in the corner of a room?\n\u00a0\n\nLast night my eyes felt embarrassed to land on any human form; they hopped like flies from object to object. I wanted to see, but where to linger, where to stay? There was no purchase. No welcoming ledge. And yet I was not sad, not really. Curious, yes, but not quite sad.\n\n\u00a0\nAugust 23, 2018\nDear G,\n(\n\u00a0\nYesterday I found out by way of a blood test that the embryo inside me no longer exists. I looked at a screen, and there was a number, and the number did not fall in a specified range.\n\u00a0\n\nWhen they executed the procedure where they scoop up the cells with a long eye dropper and inject them into a corner of my uterus, the doctor handed me a photograph of the embryo and said beautiful. What he meant was that it was the picture-perfect image of an embryo at this stage. Did I already feel discomfort then? For a year I have been trying to perfect this process, to pin all the moths in place, even the ones as thin as ghosts.\n\u00a0\n\nIn the doctor\u2019s office today, I kept trying to discern where in my body I was feeling the loss, and the doctor kept pointing to the photograph, calling this part baby and that part placenta, over and over\u2014\n\n)\n\u00a0\nAugust 23, 2018\nDear J,\n\u00a0\nI do not find my birthstone particularly beautiful. Today I told a man this, and he claimed it interesting. It\u2019s just like with your posture, he said. You misname it \u201cbad\u201d because it is yours.\n\u00a0\n\nBack straight as a stack of coins, I nodded my head, but it did not make sense.\n\u00a0\n\nHe thought he had unlocked something about me.\n\u00a0\n\nYou are throwing plastic over it, he said. An ugly plastic.\n\u00a0\n\nYes, I said, not because I agreed, but because I could visualize the act. Me, throwing a dirty milky tarp over something invisible, to see the form. How else but to ugly it?\n\u00a0\n\nBut I did not say this.\n\u00a0\n\nWe have been told certain colors are colors, he said, beautiful colors. You are uncomfortable with adornment.\n\u00a0\n\nYes, I said, uncomfortable.\n\u00a0\n\nHow so are you stone? I asked my forearm silently.\n\u00a0\n\nWe just are, it said.\n\u00a0\n\nWhat should I adorn you with, if not yourself? I asked.\n\n\u00a0\nAugust 24, 2018\nDear G,\n(\n\u00a0\nWhen I was a child, a playmate once showed me how to put socks inside my undershirt to emulate my mother\u2019s body. I was shocked because I had grown up believing we ought to bury our softest parts.\n\u00a0\n\nOnce I took a shower with my mother after swimming in the public pool, and I couldn\u2019t stop staring, couldn\u2019t stop looking away.\n\u00a0\n\nMy mother had warned me: the body does not always give you what you ask of it. When I married my husband, she told me over the phone that never mind what I feel, sometimes my body must lie there to serve another\u2019s needs.\n\u00a0\n\nIn the corner of my childhood bedroom, by the window light, my mother told me, if anyone ever touches me here or here.\n\u00a0\n\nSo later I was confused, when, in the doctor\u2019s office, she simply stood by as he touched me here, and here.\n\n(\n\u00a0\nThroughout this whole year, I have been asking my doctor, a man who touches my innermost parts and never looks me in the eyes, Is this normal?\u00a0Is this normal?

            "text": "Culture is not a piece of baggage that immigrants carry with them; it is not static but undergoes constant modification in a new environment.\n\u2014Sau-ling Cynthia Wong\n\nAgainst the fear of a general death, and against the loss of connection, a sense of life is affirmed, learned as closely in suffering as ever in joy.\n\u2014Raymond Williams\n\n\ni\nI can see for the first time a troubling of the word born of the thirty-five-year-long Japanese occupation of Korea, the division of the country by US and Soviet forces after WWII, the ongoing war at one of the most militarized borders in the world. I can see, too, an era further away. The word names the feeling that arises as you are buried alive with your dead husband. It\u2019s harder to weigh a word with a history that permanently exiles its victims. So on one side I write the word han while on the other a historian on a panel erases it. He says, \u201cKoreans outside of Korea can\u2019t know han.\u201d The historian confesses a discrimination between us. \u201cMy han is the original han.\u201d I am not Korean as I thought but a perpetual outsider. It\u2019s not a word but a war. The word I thought belongs to me only belongs to the Korean border. But if I am not uncanny, melancholy, or nostalgia, then as I see the word now and, because I can\u2019t unsee myself in it and must continue to live within and outside of this world nevertheless, I am the word.ii\nWhen I give a talk about han in DC, a young man in the audience has a panic attack. Then it happens again at a virtual talk in SF to an older woman, though I don\u2019t know until later. Both the man and woman say the room started to spin when I kept saying the word han. In psychiatry, the word causes dizziness and heart palpitations. The consequences are real.\nHow poet Kim Hyesoon defines autobiography as autotestimony: she is narrating her historical death. So on one side is how she has died while on the other is how she remains living. If I am the word, saying the word is to narrate my death. I meet the consequences here. This might be an answer to why han is trouble. The word brings up the question of how one has died and how one could remain alive.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\niii\nMy mother would try to take her life (with a kitchen knife) in the name of han. Then what does that do for me, with the word so deeply tied to my own throat?\nThe closest word I have to describe this is an opera singer\u2019s duende. Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca says, \u201cThe duende does not come at all unless he sees that death is possible.\u201d There\u2019s something more. To have han is to be a child who hoped to be loved in a manner she understood but accepts any love, because pain cannot lessen a hope for love.iv\nIn an online discussion group, han is called a meaningless word. \u201cOnly an embarrassing artifact. Like the possession of demons. Possessed people suffer, too. But the answer isn\u2019t to take demons seriously. There\u2019s no usefulness in the word. Why not call it what it is, trauma, without ethno-essentialism? What\u2019s the difference between suffering of a Korean and a Rwandan genocide survivor or a Jewish Holocaust survivor?\u201d The argument says the word has damaged Koreans, convinced them of their sorrow. It says Koreans but especially Koreans outside of Korea\u2014Korean Americans, mixed-race Koreans, adoptee Koreans, queer Koreans\u2014and their obsession with han is delusional. We\u2019ve sabotaged ourselves where healing is possible. We\u2019ve \u2028condemned ourselves to terrible pain.v\nTo hear the word has nothing to do with me. I\u2019m aware of how I now know two scholars writing about han who have given up because of the fear and repercussions if we do recognize the word as displaced persons of war and as perpetual outsiders of history, and I share their fear.\n\u00a0\n(deleted)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n(the world spins)\n\u00a0\nvi\nI\u2019m grateful to the historian. After his panel, he changes his mind. I resent him also.\nThen can han change\u2014transform? Can I talk about han as a Korean American, about how han is doing something different with my throat?vii\nA visitor writes on my page:\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Han is ethnocentric and has been cancelled by actual Koreans.\nI write:\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequences are the homogenization of Korean experiences and\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0erasure of features of marginalized literature. (deleted)viii\nHan is not just trauma, vague in western circles for colonization and war, historical defeat and inhumanity. Han, not as an illness, but a way of thinking about our lives. Han specific to Korea but not limited to Korea. Han as exile by native Koreans. Han as crossing the Pacific. The word brings me closer to the truth of living as a perpetual outsider and against the definition of han as nationhood. The earth\u2019s han, face pockmarked over a hundred years of bombing. It is not only a suffering but a suffering that is avoidable and is not avoided, a suffering that breaks us and need not break us.ix\nI go back to the discussion group. The war is ongoing. \u201cThe word wasn\u2019t cancelled\u2009... but [Korean natives] lost interest in the idea they felt no longer described their life experiences.\u201d\n\u201cAs for your conception of han as a universal idea that is a recognition of hardship and sorrow\u2009...\u2009I just do not know if that can be called han in thetraditional sense\u2009...\u2009I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s appropriate to use the same word\u2009... with little connection to the original han.\u201d \u201cAgain\u2009...\u2009wrong\u2009...\u2009define in contexts\u2009...\u2009century\u2009...\u2009vagueness of han\u2009...\u2009malleable\u2009...\u2009out of style\u2009... Korean\u2009... dropped\u2009...\u2009language\u2009... \u201dx\n\u00a0\n\nxi\nTruth is I want a world where the word does not exist. The trouble is the way it shrugs off anything. Steven Yeun\u2019s character in Burning smiles and says: \u201cThere\u2019s something in your heart. There\u2019s a stone in your heart. The stone is making you suffer. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t fully enjoy things. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t eat tasty food and appreciate it. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t tell a man you like that you like them\u2009...\u2009You have to remove it.\u201d\nI want to make clear\u2009...\u2009I believe the word\u2009...\u2009killed\u2009...\u2009and the word still lives\u2009...\u2009no denying people who suffered\u2009...\u2009they make it truthful\u2009...\u2009what is interrogated is the word\u2009...\u2009and its history\u2009...\u2009not the dead and the living\u2009...\u2009not the word as we each feel it in our bones\u2009...\u2009keep in\u2009...\u2009I may not have to discard the word\u2009...\u2009if I lead\u2009...\u2009with its shadow\u2009...\u2009limitations\u2009...\u2009its horrors\u2009...\u2009what remains is a sense of life\u2009...\u2009recognizable\u2009...\u2009as relief\u2009...\u2009then as mine\u2009...\u2009\n                \n\n\n\nCulture is not a piece of baggage that immigrants carry with them; it is not static but undergoes constant modification in a new environment.\n\u2014Sau-ling Cynthia Wong\n\nAgainst the fear of a general death, and against the loss of connection, a sense of life is affirmed, learned as closely in suffering as ever in joy.\n\u2014Raymond Williams\n\n\n\n\nCulture is not a piece of baggage that immigrants carry with them; it is not static but undergoes constant modification in a new environment.\n\u2014Sau-ling Cynthia Wong\n\nAgainst the fear of a general death, and against the loss of connection, a sense of life is affirmed, learned as closely in suffering as ever in joy.\n\u2014Raymond Williams\n\nCulture is not a piece of baggage that immigrants carry with them; it is not static but undergoes constant modification in a new environment.\n\u2014Sau-ling Cynthia Wong\n\nAgainst the fear of a general death, and against the loss of connection, a sense of life is affirmed, learned as closely in suffering as ever in joy.\n\u2014Raymond Williams\n\u00a0\n(deleted)\n(the world spins)"

We take out our phones to capture the weeping European beech\u2014the first of its kind I\u2019ve seen\u2014dangling dark papery leaves in cascading caves to mark the walkway into the house. On the drive up\nshe was already upset. All of this for just one family? she scoffed when I showed her the tickets. Why should I care about this? Now we are separated by the other tourists who look back and forth between us, not sure if we belong together. You can\u2019t takepictures inside, so we snap the arborvitae at the property edge, shoot the driveway cobbled with puzzle-piece terra-cotta.\nInside, it is marble, chilled. Notice the carpet, a perfect replica of the original. This the first famous house where I\u2019ve been let in. What a dream. 360-degree fireplace and a conversation pit, the cushion colors of which would be switched according to season. We shuffle through\nthe rooms, rotating our bodies to see it all again: the golds and greens and peacock blues. I don\u2019t know the names for any of these things except what the guide tells me: primitive figurines collected by Mr. Miller, folk art next to a glass piece that won an award at the Venice Biennale.\nThe glossy kitchen where Mrs. Miller herself clearly never cooked, island cabinets being exactly face-level to hide the expression of the one cooking or cleaning on the other side. To see the other side\nof a room, my mother steps off the beige runner and onto the stone floor and the guide stops mid-sentence to remind her to please stay on the marked path. Everyone\u2014the rest of us who have no trouble staying where we are told\u2014turns and looks. My own irritation\nI muzzle by staring into the chandelier. The house and its light, a room for each of the children. The empty wall where Monet water lilies once hung.\nThen we come to the piano. Look closer, isn\u2019t it a bit longer than your regular Steinway baby grand? And look, someone had painted the underside a deep red. For my first five years in this country, I played a tinny keyboard. Then my mother bought a one-hundred-year-old spinet\nfrom a church yard sale. We sanded its varnish-flecked body smooth and painted it baby blue. It never held its tune, but it played, notes leaking into each other, filling the apartment with sound. Don\u2019t worry, I want to tell her now, softening, there\u2019s a museum for that, too.\n\u00a0\n                \n\n\n\nColumbus, Indiana\n\n\n\n\nColumbus, Indiana\n\nColumbus, Indiana"

You once told\n her you\u2019d be a doctor, a lawyer, someone\n better at filling the family\u2019s gaps. You lied.\n You\u2019re grown now, and you still can\u2019t figure out\n where all the pieces go. See if you can\u2019t find\n the bullet, which might not have been\n in his head at all. (No one tells this story,\n and, according to your bourgie cousin, neither\n should you.) It might have ambled to the surface;\n feel for bumps on his skin, check the roof of his mouth\n under the composite bridge if there is one. When\n you asked your mother Was he a womanizer? A cheat? Just bad?\n she said no, but you have both wrapped\n your legs around disasters and called them gods.\n Prop him up: palms on his knees in the old chair.\n Leave his butter cookies under the cushion\n so when a younger you comes sugartoothed and begging,\n they\u2019re waiting like yellow, crisp commas. Unlight\n the match. Let the mattress cool to a white pill.\n Remove the matchbook from his wife\u2019s hands;\n remove her from the room\u2014give him a little\n peace. Or you can leave her there, just make her\n good. Harvest a bit of\u200a\u200a bone from her sternum\n to let the devils free so that, later,\n when your youngest uncle pins you down\n for being sassy, for stealing the remote\n \u2014for being seven\u2014and demands\n you name the legions that left the great-\n grandmother to enter you, his mouth\n gapes like a grouper, with nothing to say.\n Disappear the tools from both their hands.\n You are bigger than the story of being pinned.\n In the ancestral yard, gather the dingy chickens\n and Butch with his golden withers, who is chasing the cat\n that same uncle plucked eyeless with a clothes hanger.\n Gather the sisters in the other house, too, naked\n and soapy in the steel tub. Seal them in wax,\n so that no one who ever touches them can leave\n a trace. And the mother, wrangling their hair\n with bergamot and water, with the pig-\n colored brush and its stout bristles\u2014seal the hole\n blown through her chest when the father left.\n Which father? Any father. Take your pick.\n Which hole? Every hole she hides with blouses\n and the printed scarves she shouts loose in church.\n Make all fathers inconsequential except one,\n for whom you will pinch a crease into a pair\n of\u200a trousers and walk him from one house to another,\n maybe carrying the cookies as a gift; maybe carrying\n milk from the dairy where the white owner told him\n he shouldn\u2019t have more children; where he probably\n said nothing, just dipped the cow\u2019s udder\n into a pan of chlorinated water, the premonition\n of his wife\u2019s homicidal want as acrid as the dung\n curdling the air. Now he is coming\n to live with the daughters\u2019 daughters\u2014the speckled line\n that slipped through just before the culling. And even though\n you didn\u2019t know him well enough to know\n what he might do once he arrives,\n such ignorance has never stopped you before.\n\nGlue the slivers of your great-grandfather\u2019s skull\n\n back together with spit. You might have to hold it\n\n in place until it sets, but first, pick the brain\n\n matter blowback from his wife\u2019s nightdress,\n\n and poke it back through the holes. You once told\n\n her you\u2019d be a doctor, a lawyer, someone\n\n better at filling the family\u2019s gaps. You lied.\n\n You\u2019re grown now, and you still can\u2019t figure out\n\n where all the pieces go. See if you can\u2019t find\n\n the bullet, which might not have been\n\n in his head at all. (No one tells this story,\n\n and, according to your bourgie cousin, neither\n\n should you.) It might have ambled to the surface;\n\n feel for bumps on his skin, check the roof of his mouth\n\n under the composite bridge if there is one. When\n\n you asked your mother Was he a womanizer? A cheat? Just bad?\n\n she said no, but you have both wrapped\n\n your legs around disasters and called them gods.\n\n Prop him up: palms on his knees in the old chair.\n\n Leave his butter cookies under the cushion\n\n so when a younger you comes sugartoothed and begging,\n\n they\u2019re waiting like yellow, crisp commas. Unlight\n\n the match. Let the mattress cool to a white pill.\n\n Remove the matchbook from his wife\u2019s hands;\n\n remove her from the room\u2014give him a little\n\n peace. Or you can leave her there, just make her\n\n good. Harvest a bit of\u200a\u200a bone from her sternum\n\n to let the devils free so that, later,\n\n when your youngest uncle pins you down\n\n for being sassy, for stealing the remote\n\n \u2014for being seven\u2014and demands\n\n you name the legions that left the great-\n\n grandmother to enter you, his mouth\n\n gapes like a grouper, with nothing to say.\n\n Disappear the tools from both their hands.\n\n You are bigger than the story of being pinned.\n\n In the ancestral yard, gather the dingy chickens\n\n and Butch with his golden withers, who is chasing the cat\n\n that same uncle plucked eyeless with a clothes hanger.\n\n Gather the sisters in the other house, too, naked\n\n and soapy in the steel tub. Seal them in wax,\n\n so that no one who ever touches them can leave\n\n a trace. And the mother, wrangling their hair\n\n with bergamot and water, with the pig-\n\n colored brush and its stout bristles\u2014seal the hole\n\n blown through her chest when the father left.\n\n Which father? Any father. Take your pick.\n\n Which hole? Every hole she hides with blouses\n\n and the printed scarves she shouts loose in church.\n\n Make all fathers inconsequential except one,\n\n for whom you will pinch a crease into a pair\n\n of\u200a trousers and walk him from one house to another,\n\n maybe carrying the cookies as a gift; maybe carrying\n\n milk from the dairy where the white owner told him\n\n he shouldn\u2019t have more children; where he probably\n\n said nothing, just dipped the cow\u2019s udder\n\n into a pan of chlorinated water, the premonition\n\n of his wife\u2019s homicidal want as acrid as the dung\n\n curdling the air. Now he is coming\n\n to live with the daughters\u2019 daughters\u2014the speckled line\n\n that slipped through just before the culling. And even though\n\n you didn\u2019t know him well enough to know\n\n what he might do once he arrives,\n\n such ignorance has never stopped you before."

We found\n girls trampled by trains and set to pick-and-roll\n the brother into blues. We read The Most Dangerous\n Game aloud as we braided our hair. The boys\n danced to the soundtrack of the hood: raps\n on the door, numbers on the porch, and dozens\n shot on the other side of the court, till laughter\n bounced off the backboards and pierced our chests.\n We call out to the gangly boys hands up! and stretch\n marks snicker up our sides when their teammates\n say, don\u2019t shoot! We took the charge when they spit\n in our direction. The light-brights only come outside\n at dusk. We were crushed velvet, stomping\n our feet on stars to take flight. The park is a wake\n of air currents from the boys who gave up the ghost.\n The season of dead Black boys pulls us\n like an August moon, a high-top fading\n as we all remember the court.\n\nThe boys box-out in twos, shuffling on the balls\n\n of their feet like they got the ghost.

We spent our knees on this.\n\n We\u2019d cheer the boys into turnovers, coo at pivots,\n\n turn our feet so they didn\u2019t know we\u2019d go\n\n with them. Some days, they played foul. We found\n\n girls trampled by trains and set to pick-and-roll\n\n the brother into blues. We read The Most Dangerous\n\n Game aloud as we braided our hair. The boys\n\n danced to the soundtrack of the hood: raps\n\n on the door, numbers on the porch, and dozens\n\n shot on the other side of the court, till laughter\n\n bounced off the backboards and pierced our chests.\n\n We call out to the gangly boys hands up! and stretch\n\n marks snicker up our sides when their teammates\n\n say, don\u2019t shoot! We took the charge when they spit\n\n in our direction. The light-brights only come outside\n\n at dusk. We were crushed velvet, stomping\n\n our feet on stars to take flight. The park is a wake\n\n of air currents from the boys who gave up the ghost.\n\n The season of dead Black boys pulls us\n\n like an August moon, a high-top fading\n\n as we all remember the court."
